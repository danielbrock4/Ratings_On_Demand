## Summary:

## Description
This repository contains a working model to predict IMDb ratings for a movie using features available prior to the movie's release. The model uses linear regression and features obtained through Kaggle.

## Overview:
Online ratings are an indispensable part of how we watch movies. They condense an entire feature-length production into a single metric, giving us a measure by which to decide, within seconds, whether it's worthy of our time or not.

Ratings on Demand is a project aimed at predicting IMDb movie ratings using features available prior to a movie’s release like genre, movie duration, budget, and actor/director Oscar success. The implemented predictor system uses linear regression for predicting the outcome rating, bringing insights about the data. In order to achieve this, we gathered our features obtained through various Kaggle datasets and web scraping IMDb’s website.

## Questions Answered by Our Data:

* Can we accurately predict IMDb ratings with general movie attributes?

  * Is our dataset sufficient enough to produce accurate film ratings? If not, what other means need to be explored?

* What correlations, if any, can be drawn between our chosen features and an accurate IMDb rating?
  
  * Are there any potential patterns that can be used to determine a movie's rating? For example, do movies with summer time release dates involving Oscar award winners produce play any part in a movie's IMDb rating. 

* Which Machine Learning algorithm would provide the most accurate prediction?
